### DATA CLEANING

- Duplicate Values: Checked for duplicate company entries in the datasets. Bolt and Fabric were identified as duplicates but were preserved as they operate in different locations.

- Column Renaming: Columns were renamed for consistency and clarity. For example, Year Founded was renamed to Year_Founded.

- Date Formatting: Dates were reformatted to standard date types, and new columns (Year_Joined, Month_Joined, Day_Joined) were created to facilitate time-based analysis.

- Unnecessary Data Removal: Removed rows with unknown or zero funding values to ensure data accuracy.
